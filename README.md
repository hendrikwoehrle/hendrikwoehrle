- 👋 Hi, I’m @hendrikwoehrle. I am an professor for Information Technology at the Dortmund University of Applied Sciences and Arts in Germany.
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine and Deep Learning and Hardware Development, especially custom Hardware Accelerators for Deep Learning and Robotics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a bunch of stuff... I am always interested in new technologies and methods. However, unfortunately I always have not enough time to satisfy my curiosity.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my interests outlined above. Furthermode, Auto-ML is an interesting idea!
- 📫 You can reach me here or via my official mail/phone. That can be easily discovered on the WEb!
